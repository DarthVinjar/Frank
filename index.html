Living away from home at 16 has been a huge change in my life. At first, it felt exciting, like a big adventure, but it 
didn’t take long for reality to sink in. I suddenly had to do things I never really thought about before, like cooking, 
doing my own laundry, and managing my time without anyone reminding me. It was a bit overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
I miss my family a lot. The quiet moments, the noise, even the arguments—it’s strange not having all that around me anymore. 
Sometimes I feel really homesick, especially on tough days. But at the same time, I’ve started learning a lot about myself. 
I’m becoming more responsible, more organized, and more confident in doing things on my own.
</p>

Being away from home at this age isn’t something everyone experiences, and it’s definitely not easy. But I know it’s helping me become 
more independent, and in a strange way, it’s made me appreciate home more than ever.
